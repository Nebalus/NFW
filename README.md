# NFW (NebalusFrameWork)
The Idea is to create a framework with different modules to create seppreate tasks... One module is used to create DC-Bots easyer, another one is a Minecraft Module where you can make better Minecraft plugins.

Basicly this framework provides helper classes wich you can build on it
